# 📘 Full Implementation Roadmap: School Management System (Raw Python)

## 🧾 Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build a comprehensive school management system using **raw Python** and supporting packages. No frameworks will be used. All components will be modular and maintainable.

  - [ ] Transportation System (Shuttle Tracker)
  - [ ] Notifications (SMS, Email)
  - [ ] Attendance & Class Schedules
  - [ ] Role-based Access Control
  - [ ] Real-time Location Tracking

### ✅ Step 2: Environment Setup
- [ ] Create a virtual environment
- [ ] Use `pip` for package installation

### 📦 Required Packages:
- HTTP Server: `http.server`, `socketserver`, `gunicorn`
- Routing: `werkzeug.routing`
- ORM & DB: `SQLAlchemy`, `psycopg2` or `sqlite3`
- Data Validation: `pydantic`, `marshmallow`
- Biometric: `opencv-python`, `face_recognition`
- PDF & Card: `reportlab`, `qrcode`, `Pillow`
- Auth & Security: `bcrypt`, `python-jose`, `itsdangerous`
- Messaging: `smtplib`, `twilio`
- Background Tasks: `celery`, `redis`
- Scheduling: `schedule`, `apscheduler`
- Location Tracking: `geopy`, `sockets`, `requests`
- Testing: `pytest`, `unittest`
- Documentation: `swagger-spec-validator`, `PyYAML`
- Logging: `logging`, `psutil`

## 🗂️ Phase 2: Database Architecture

### ✅ Step 3: Design Core Tables (using SQLAlchemy)
- [ ] `users`, `roles`, `permissions`
- [ ] `students`, `staff`, `parents`, `guardians`, `alumni`
- [ ] `courses`, `departments`, `programmes`, `semesters`
- [ ] `grades`, `transcripts`, `results`, `assessments`
- [ ] `fees`, `payments`, `scholarships`
- [ ] `notifications`, `messages`, `announcements`
- [ ] `shuttles`, `routes`, `assignments`, `requests`
- [ ] `biometric_data`, `face_encodings`, `fingerprint_hashes`
- [ ] `activity_logs`, `audit_trails`

### ✅ Step 4: Database Management
- [ ] Create migration strategy using `alembic`
- [ ] Define indexes, constraints, and relationships
- [ ] Normalize and optimize DB schema

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ Step 5: Authentication Logic
- [ ] Use JWT (via `python-jose`)
- [ ] Secure password storage (`bcrypt`)
- [ ] Role-specific login paths

### ✅ Step 6: Access Control
- [ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Decorator-based route protection

---

## 📚 Phase 4: Admissions & Registration

### ✅ Step 7: Admission Workflow
- [ ] Collect personal & academic data
- [ ] Capture student photo (via webcam)
- [ ] Verify documents
- [ ] Store biometric signature

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Academic Records & Grading

### ✅ Step 8: Grading Setup
- [ ] Define custom grade rules per school
- [ ] GPA/CGPA calculation logic
- [ ] Grade entry, editing, and lock states

### ✅ Step 9: Transcript Generation
- [ ] Format academic transcript
- [ ] Generate PDF via `reportlab`
- [ ] Add QR and watermark

---

## 🚌 Phase 6: Shuttle & Transportation

### ✅ Step 10: Shuttle Assignment
- [ ] Link hall to campus route
- [ ] Store route schedules
- [ ] Generate real-time tracker via `sockets`

---

## 🧬 Phase 7: Biometrics

### ✅ Step 11: Facial and Fingerprint Recognition
- [ ] Capture live image (via `opencv-python`)
- [ ] Detect and compare face encodings
- [ ] Integrate fingerprint scanner SDK
- [ ] Store biometric securely in DB

---

## 💳 Phase 8: Student Cards

### ✅ Step 12: ID Card Generator
- [ ] Design layout with student photo, QR code, and details
- [ ] Generate printable card (PDF or PNG)
- [ ] Add barcode for access control

---

## 💰 Phase 9: Fee Management System

### ✅ Step 13: Fee Rules
- [ ] Define by level and programme
- [ ] Assign scholarships or fee waivers
- [ ] Track payment status (full, partial, pending)

### ✅ Step 14: Receipts & Invoices
- [ ] Auto-generate receipts upon payment
- [ ] Allow staff to record cash payments

---

## 🔔 Phase 10: Notifications

### ✅ Step 15: Event-Based Notifications
- [ ] Notify parents on attendance, grades, shuttle status
- [ ] Send via email (`smtplib`) or SMS (`twilio`)
- [ ] Log sent notifications

---

## 📡 Phase 11: Real-time Attendance & Location

### ✅ Step 16: Geo + Time Logs
- [ ] Use GPS module (`geopy`) for real-time tracking
- [ ] Log timestamp and coordinates on login
- [ ] Track teacher check-in and class sessions

---

## 🧪 Phase 12: Testing

### ✅ Step 17: Manual & Automated Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules (`unittest`, `pytest`)
- [ ] Mock biometric data and API calls
- [ ] Test card rendering and PDF generation

---

## 📑 Phase 13: Documentation

### ✅ Step 18: Swagger API Documentation
- [ ] Define routes and request/response formats
- [ ] Use `swagger-spec-validator` and `PyYAML`

---

## 🚀 Phase 14: Deployment

### ✅ Step 19: Prepare for Production
- [ ] Use `gunicorn` with reverse proxy (`nginx`)
- [ ] Install SSL & secure headers
- [ ] Enable logging, backup, and uptime monitor

---

## 🛠️ Phase 15: Maintenance

### ✅ Step 20: Maintainability Plan
- [ ] Schedule cron jobs for backups
- [ ] Monitor system health with `psutil`
- [ ] Log activities and errors
- [ ] Plan for feature extensions

---

## 📌 Final Notes
- All modules are to be written in **raw Python** using only **lightweight packages**.
- No external web frameworks will be used.
- All APIs are RESTful and documented using Swagger.
- Project will be built in **phases**, each tested and version-controlled.
