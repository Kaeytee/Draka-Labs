Based on your instructions, current code, and the system‚Äôs architecture, here‚Äôs a prioritized list of next steps to continue building your school management backend:

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done
- **School and User models** with professional relationships.
- **School registration logic** (admin + school created together).
- **Helper functions** for ID, username, email, and password generation.
- **Database and hot reload setup.**

---



### 1. **Class Management**
- **Model:** Create `Class` model (e.g., `models/class.py`) with fields: name, description, academic year, school_id, class_teacher_id.
- **Service:** Add service to create classes (school admin only).
- **Handler:** Add endpoint for class creation.

### 2. **Course Management**
- **Model:** Create `Course` model (e.g., `models/course.py`) with fields: title, code, credit hours, grading type, class_id, teacher_id.
- **Service:** Add service to create courses and auto-generate teacher accounts.
- **Handler:** Add endpoint for course creation.
## üü° Next Steps (in recommended order)
### 3. **Auto-Generate Teachers**
- **Service:** When a course is created, auto-create a teacher user (using your helpers).
- **Assign:** Link teacher to course and school.

### 4. **Student Enrollment**
- **Model:** Create `StudentClass` or `Enrollment` model to link students to classes/courses.
- **Service:** Add service to enroll students (auto-generate student accounts, assign to class/courses).
- **Handler:** Add endpoint for student enrollment.

### 5. **Grade Management**
- **Model:** Create `Grade` model (student_id, course_id, value, created_at, updated_at, graded_by).
- **Service:** Add service for teachers to upload grades.
- **Handler:** Add endpoint for grade upload.

### 6. **Grading System Management**
- **Service:** Allow school admin to update grading system (JSON).
- **Logic:** Ensure grade recalculation when grading system changes.

### 7. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Middleware/Service:** Enforce permissions for each endpoint (admin, teacher, student).

### 8. **Audit & Timestamps**
- **Ensure:** All grade changes include `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `graded_by`.

### 9. **Testing & Validation**
- **Add:** Data validation and error handling for all endpoints.
- **Write:** Unit tests for core services.
